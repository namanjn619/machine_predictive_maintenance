## ðŸš€ About Me
I am Naman Jain, currently pursuing my M.Tech in Data Science at Delhi Technological University, New Delhi. With a solid foundation in Computer Engineering from Arya College of Engineering and IT, Jaipur, I have developed a keen interest in machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics.

My journey in the tech world includes practical experience as a Software Engineer at APBundle Technologies, where I honed my skills in ReactJS, NodeJS, and Redux, and as a Software Engineer Intern at WisdmLabs, focusing on PHP, WordPress, and MySQL. My technical expertise spans across various programming languages like Python, C++, and JavaScript, and I am proficient in using tools such as Docker, Git, and Power BI.

In my latest project, "Machine Predictive Maintenance," I have utilized machine learning algorithms to predict machine failures and identify specific failure types. This project not only highlights my ability to develop robust machine learning models but also showcases my proficiency in data visualization and analytics using Streamlit and Power BI.

  
## Features

- Model Comparison: We have evaluated and compared the results of the aforementioned machine learning models to determine the most effective one for predicting machine failures. This comparison is based on key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Live Prediction Page: Utilizing the best-performing model, we have created a live prediction page. This feature allows users to input new data and receive real-time predictions about the machine's maintenance status, enhancing decision-making and proactive maintenance efforts.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualizations: Comprehensive EDA has been conducted to uncover patterns and insights from the data. Various graphs and visualizations accompany the EDA, providing a deeper understanding of the factors influencing machine failures.
- Power BI Dashboard: For advanced data analytics and interactive exploration, we have developed a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard offers an intuitive interface to analyze trends, compare model performances, and monitor machine health metrics dynamically.

### Home Page
In this project, we aim to predict whether a machine is in a state of failure and, if so, identify the specific type of failure. The types of failures considered are:
- Heat Dissipation Failure
- Power Failure
- Overstrain Failure
- Tool Wear Failure

To accomplish this, we have implemented and compared the performance of four machine learning algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

### Dataset Used
The dataset contains 9,973 entries with 9 columns, each representing various attributes related to machine operations and failure status.
Columns and Data Types
- Type (object): Indicates the type of machine or operation.
- Air temperature [C] (float64): The ambient air temperature in degrees Celsius.
- Process temperature [C] (float64): The temperature of the process in degrees Celsius.
