## ðŸš€ About Me
I am Naman Jain, currently pursuing my M.Tech in Data Science at Delhi Technological University, New Delhi. With a solid foundation in Computer Engineering from Arya College of Engineering and IT, Jaipur, I have developed a keen interest in machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics.

My journey in the tech world includes practical experience as a Software Engineer at APBundle Technologies, where I honed my skills in ReactJS, NodeJS, and Redux, and as a Software Engineer Intern at WisdmLabs, focusing on PHP, WordPress, and MySQL. My technical expertise spans across various programming languages like Python, C++, and JavaScript, and I am proficient in using tools such as Docker, Git, and Power BI.

In my latest project, "Machine Predictive Maintenance," I have utilized machine learning algorithms to predict machine failures and identify specific failure types. This project not only highlights my ability to develop robust machine learning models but also showcases my proficiency in data visualization and analytics using Streamlit and Power BI.

  
## Features

- Model Comparison: We have evaluated and compared the results of the aforementioned machine learning models to determine the most effective one for predicting machine failures. This comparison is based on key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Live Prediction Page: Utilizing the best-performing model, we have created a live prediction page. This feature allows users to input new data and receive real-time predictions about the machine's maintenance status, enhancing decision-making and proactive maintenance efforts.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualizations: Comprehensive EDA has been conducted to uncover patterns and insights from the data. Various graphs and visualizations accompany the EDA, providing a deeper understanding of the factors influencing machine failures.
- Power BI Dashboard: For advanced data analytics and interactive exploration, we have developed a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard offers an intuitive interface to analyze trends, compare model performances, and monitor machine health metrics dynamically.
